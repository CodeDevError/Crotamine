A web based C2C rat for windows!


I decided to publish this as its partly finished. The problem is after i added one fucking line the server.py would no longer open.
It wouldnt even connect.

Despite asking multiple ai's and even paying for a subscription they all started adding worse code to it. 
To the point where they would just remove large portions of code which the code relies on to work.


CONCLUSION.
I had big plans for this however i cant be bothered anymore and am starting a new project.
I have made it easy to navigate the code and see how it works.

Instrucitons:
Open server.py, (once you fixed it)
Open http://127.0.0.1:5000
There you go open client.py to test.
